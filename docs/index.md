# Lua Lander Documentation

Hello. This project is heavily inspired by [LoDash](https://lodash.com/). It is an effort to expand upon Lua's native API, adding common, useful functions used in all kinds of projects. The only dependency is `>= Lua 5.1`.

> Note: This package is in alpha, and continually updating.
